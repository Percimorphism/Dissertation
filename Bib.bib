Furthermore, the known entries are noisy modeled through additive independent random variables with strictly sub-Gaussian distribution, $\textsc{S}\textsc{ub}(c^2(d))$ with a bounded constant dependent on the distance $d$ between the microphone pairs. In this report, we exploit matrix completion approach to recover the full distance matrix. We derive the theoretical guarantees of microphone calibration performance which demonstrates that the error of calibrating a network of $N$ microphones using matrix completion decreases as $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$.},

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

(p. 386, published online 27 March; see the Perspective by O{\textquoteright}Leary and Marder) developed a broadly applicable optogenetic method for neuron-behavior mapping and used it to phenotype larval Drosophila and thus developed a reference atlas. As optogenetic experiments become routine in certain fields of neuroscience research, creating even more specialized tools is imperative (see the Perspective by Hayashi). By engineering channelrhodopsin, Wietek et al. (p. 409, published online 27 March) and Berndt et al. (p. 420) created two different light-gated anion channels to block action potential generation during synaptic stimulation or depolarizing current injections. These new tools not only improve understanding of channelrhodopsins but also provide a way to silence cells. A single nervous system can generate many distinct motor patterns. Identifying which neurons and circuits control which behaviors has been a laborious piecemeal process, usually for one observer-defined behavior at a time. We present a fundamentally different approach to neuron-behavior mapping. We optogenetically activated 1054 identified neuron lines in Drosophila larvae and tracked the behavioral responses from 37,780 animals. Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.},

A corresponding method of analyzing similarities data is proposed, involving a generalization of ``Eckart-Young analysis'' to decomposition of three-way (or higher-way) tables. In the present case this decomposition is applied to a derived three-way table of scalar products between stimuli for individuals. This analysis yields a stimulus by dimensions coordinate matrix and a subjects by dimensions matrix of weights. This method is illustrated with data on auditory stimuli and on perception of nations.",

abstract="Suppose dissimilarity data have been collected on a set of n objects or individuals, where there is a value of dissimilarity measured for each pair.The dissimilarity measure used might be a subjective judgement made by a judge, where for example a teacher subjectively scores the strength of friendship between pairs of pupils in her class, or, as an alternative, more objective, measure, she might count the number of contacts made in a day between each pair of pupils. In other situations the dissimilarity measure might be based on a data matrix. The general aim of multidimensional scaling is to find a configuration of points in a space, usually Euclidean, where each point represents one of the objects or individuals, and the distances between pairs of points in the configuration match as well as possible the original dissimilarities between the pairs of objects or individuals. Such configurations can be found using metric and non-metric scaling, which are covered in Sects. 2 and 3. A number of other techniques are covered by the umbrella title of multidimensional scaling (MDS), and here the techniques of Procrustes analysis, unidimensional scaling, individual differences scaling, correspondence analysis and reciprocal averaging are briefly introduced and illustrated with pertinent data sets.",

abstract="We prove a central limit theorem for the components of the largest eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of a finite-dimensional random dot product graph whose true latent positions are unknown. We use the spectral embedding of the adjacency matrix to construct consistent estimates for the latent positions, and we show that the appropriately scaled differences between the estimated and true latent positions converge to a mixture of Gaussian random variables. We state several corollaries, including an alternate proof of a central limit theorem for the first eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of an Erdos-R{\'e}nyi random graph.",

  author    = "Shi, Tao and Horvath, Steve",
  abstract  = "A random forest (RF) predictor is an ensemble of individual tree
               predictors. As part of their construction, RF predictors
               naturally lead to a dissimilarity measure between the
               observations. One can also define an RF dissimilarity measure
               between unlabeled data: the idea is to construct an RF predictor
               that distinguishes the ?observed? data from suitably generated
               synthetic data. The observed data are the original unlabeled
               data and the synthetic data are drawn from a reference
               distribution. Here we describe the properties of the RF
               dissimilarity and make recommendations on how to use it in
               practice.An RF dissimilarity can be attractive because it
               handles mixed variable types well, is invariant to monotonic
               transformations of the input variables, and is robust to
               outlying observations. The RF dissimilarity easily deals with a
               large number of variables due to its intrinsic variable
               selection; for example, the Addcl 1 RF dissimilarity weighs the
               contribution of each variable according to how dependent it is
               on other variables.We find that the RF dissimilarity is useful
               for detecting tumor sample clusters on the basis of tumor marker
               expressions. In this application, biologically meaningful
               clusters can often be described with simple thresholding rules.",

@PhDThesis{thesis,
   abstract            = {The success of diffusion MRI is deeply rooted in
                         the fact that during their micrometric random
                         displacements water molecules explore tissue
                         microstructure. Hence by labeling magnetically
                         spins of displaced water, diffusion MRI provides
                         us with exquisite information about the sizes and
                         orientations on the multiple compartments present
                         inside an imaging voxel. Through the causal
                         relation between on one hand the imaged
                         restricted and oriented water mobility and on the
                         other hand the axonal orientations in brain white
                         matter, diffusion MRI has become a powerful
                         method to infer fiber tract architecture and
                         brain anatomic connectivity. This work is not
                         only a journey that takes us from essential
                         diffusion MRI physics to an investigation of the
                         brain neuronal circuitry, but also a thesis
                         aiming at demonstrating the power of large scale
                         analysis of brain connectivity, where every
                         technological component is essential. After a
                         short introduction on molecular diffusion and
                         diffusion NMR, we start by showing that diffusion
                         contrast is positive. This key issue that was
                         only postulated up to now, allows us to justify
                         why diffusion can be computed accurately with the
                         only signal modulus. Accordingly, various
                         emerging MRI techniques that map non-Gaussian
                         diffusion have found a sound justification. In
                         particular it is precisely the result that allows
                         us to map distribution of diffusion related spin
                         displacements by Fourier transformation of the
                         measured signal modulus, hence to do Diffusion
                         Spectrum MRI. We show through multiples MR
                         experiments how the shape of this distribution in
                         a complicated multi-compartment biological system
                         can be measured and how its characteristic local
                         heterogeneity is a mirror of fiber architectures.
                         We discuss in detail its interpretation and its
                         relation to other diffusion MRI techniques.
                         Tractography is the necessary link that from
                         diffusion MRI provides us with nerve fiber
                         trajectories and maps of brain axonal
                         connectivity. In this thesis two algorithms are
                         proposed, while the first is designed for
                         diffusion tensor MRI, the second is shaped for
                         high angular resolution diffusion MRI and
                         specifically tested on Diffusion Spectrum MRI.
                         After having considered the potentials and the
                         limitations of these line generation algorithms,
                         we investigate whether tractography can be
                         formulated as a segmentation problem in a high
                         dimensional non Euclidean space, i.e.
                         position-orientation space. With the help of the
                         developed tools we address some key
                         neuro-scientific questions. Based on diffusion
                         tensor MRI data of 32 healthy volunteers,
                         language networks are investigated. It is shown
                         that right-handed men are massively
                         interconnected between the left-hemisphere speech
                         areas whereas the homologous in the right
                         hemisphere are sparse; furthermore
                         interhemispheric connections between the speech
                         areas and their contralatera1 homologues are
                         relatively strong. Women and left-handed men have
                         equally strong intrahemispheric connections in
                         both hemispheres, but women have a higher density
                         of interhemispheric connections. After this
                         quantitative study, Diffusion Spectrum MRI data
                         of a single subject is collected and tractography
                         performed in order to analyze the global
                         connectivity pattern of the human brain. For this
                         purpose we propose to model this large scale
                         architecture by an abstract graph. It is shown
                         that the long-range axonal network exhibits a
                         "small world" topology. This type of particular
                         architecture is present in various large scale
                         communication networks. They emerge usually from
                         a growing process where optimal communication has
                         to be developed under some resource constraints.
                         Furthermore we show also that the architecture of
                         axonal connectivity between cortical areas
                         exhibits a hierarchical organization. These
                         results, which confirm more indirect studies,
                         provide essential material to discuss not only
                         brain evolution and development but also
                         information processing at the level of the brain.},
